# About

Grim Mettle is a browser game, primarily developed with mobiles and smaller devices in mind. It lets you create a classic RPG-style hero complete with stats and various gear pieces.

Designed to be played in short intervals over time the game makes use of a couple of different resources which regenerate every 3 minutes.

The game offers multiple weapons and armours along with matching skills, allowing you to customise and build your hero as you wish as you strive to take down every stronger foes.

Grim Mettle is still in the early stages of development with features being added as they reach a playable and polished enough state. Being a hobby solo project aimed at improving my own skills as a coder a lot of time is spent exploring and trying out various solutions and ideas.
